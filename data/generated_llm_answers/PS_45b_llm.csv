deepseek_PS_45b_54,PS_45b,"Nathaniel and Sammy are trying to make up a code for sending messages to each other by dropping items in a drop chamber and listening to them. Sammy wants to design a code using blocks made of plastic, metal, and wood. Nathaniel thinks it would be a better idea to use wooden blocks of different sizes and shapes. Which student's method would make it easier to tell the difference between the sounds? Why?","- The size and weight of metal blocks could potentially make them land with more force than wooden ones, leading to louder sounds upon impact.","The size and weight of metal blocks could potentially make them land with more force than wooden ones, leading to louder sounds upon impact",partially_correct_incomplete
