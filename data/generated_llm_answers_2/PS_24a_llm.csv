When I pull down and tighten the string on the FOSS-ulele, then pluck the string, the pitch sounds HIGHER than it did before. But aren't I making the string longer when I pull the string? I thought a longer length produced a LOWER pitch. What's going on here? What is causing the pitch to be higher? Write a note to David to tell him why the pitch gets higher rather than lower.","* When you pull a string taught, you create higher tensions that can cause faster vibrations leading to quicker alternation between compression and rarefaction cycles within sound waves being emitted which results in an apparent upscaling of fundamental frequency (pitch) despite overall physical elongation not contributing directly towards lowering frequencies here as perceived by David.","When you pull a string taught, you create higher tensions that can cause faster vibrations leading to quicker alternation between compression and rarefaction cycles within sound waves being emitted which results in an apparent upscaling of fundamental frequency (pitch) despite overall physical elongation not contributing directly towards lowering frequencies here as perceived by David",contradictory
