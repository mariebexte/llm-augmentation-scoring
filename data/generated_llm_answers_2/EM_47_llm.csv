deepseek_EM_47_127,EM_47,The sand and flour in the gray material from mock rocks is separated by mixing with water and allowing the mixture to settle. Explain why the sand and flour separate.,"- The container was not thoroughly cleaned beforehand, resulting in contamination and subsequent poor separation outcomes for both materials.
