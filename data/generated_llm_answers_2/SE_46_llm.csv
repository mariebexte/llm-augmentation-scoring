Every 5 minutes, Amber recorded the temperature in each box. Will the data support Amber's prediction? Explain your answer.",9. Comparing just one set of variables—color versus non-color—doesn’t account for other potentially influential elements such as surface area or box material properties that could affect heat absorption and retention rates.,Comparing just one set of variables—color versus non-color—doesn’t account for other potentially influential elements such as surface area or box material properties that could affect heat absorption and retention rates,irrelevant
