Do the 2 saturated solutions have the same concentration? Explain your answer.,"- The concentrations differ because more water allows for more solute (solid) dissolution before the solution becomes fully saturated in both cases, affecting overall potency differently.","The concentrations differ because more water allows for more solute (solid) dissolution before the solution becomes fully saturated in both cases, affecting overall potency differently",1.0

Do the 2 saturated solutions have the same concentration? Explain your answer.,"10. The concentration is primarily determined by the solute’s capacity to combine with solvent molecules, which isn’t altered by changes in solution size. - No, because Mariella used less solid to dissolve in her solution which means it would have a higher concentration than Richard's.","The concentration is primarily determined by the solute’s capacity to combine with solvent molecules, which isn’t altered by changes in solution size. - No, because Mariella used less solid to dissolve in her solution which means it would have a higher concentration than Richard's",1.0
