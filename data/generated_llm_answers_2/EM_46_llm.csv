Here are some examples of students' responses that would be considered irrelevant to correctly identifying calcite and salt crystals in an evaporation dish, as they do not address the key distinguishing features between the two:","I collected them during a school field trip to the beach**: This response doesn’t address how one distinguishes crystals from calcite tests versus salt; it’s more about where they were found rather than their features or differences.
