MX.22a.385.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	You can see through it.
MX.22a.386.1	MX_22a	1.0	It is one material that dissolves into the other. Making a clear mixture. Although it could be colored, it has to be see through.
MX.22a.390.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	It is a clear mixture.
MX.22a.391.1	MX_22a	1.0	It dissolves the solid into a liquid that is see through.
MX.22a.396.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	It has to be a fairly clear.
MX.22a.397.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	A solution is a solid and a liquid mixed together.
MX.22a.400.1	MX_22a	1.0	In a solution one of the materials dissolves and the mixture is see through.
MX.22a.416.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	A solution is different because a solution is a mixture of a solid material and a liquid.
MX.22a.419.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	Because 2 mixtures become a solution. A solution is different because mixture cannot become a solution only 2 can.
MX.22a.421.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	The difference from other mixtures was that we only used 2 and other people might use 3 or 4.
MX.22a.422.1	MX_22a	1.0	A solution is when you take a mixture like powder and mix it with water then after stirring it, it becomes a solution.
MX.22a.426.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Because it is made of 2 mixtures, and making it one mixture and becoming a solution of 2 mixtures.
MX.22a.463.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	A solution is 2 materials put together and the one dissolves. And on a mixture they stay so you can see it.
MX.22a.466.1	MX_22a	1.0	It is different because in other mixtures the liquid dissolves but in a solution the solid material dissolves.
MX.22a.472.1	MX_22a	contradictory	A solution is different from a mixture because it is when you mix 2 or more things and a solution is when like water and salt dissolves or evaporated.
MX.22a.473.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	When you make solution tiny particles of the solid explained some cannot see it.
MX.22a.495.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	The solid material dissolves.
MX.22a.499.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	A solution is a different type of mixture. Then they are a solution is a mixtures that dissolves.
MX.22a.502.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	The salt dissolved in the mixture.
MX.22a.521.1	MX_22a	1.0	A solution something that dissolves.
MX.22a.527.1	MX_22a	1.0	A solution is something that dissolves into the liquid and a mixture is something mixed up together.
MX.22a.528.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	When the mixture is mixed.
MX.22a.530.1	MX_22a	contradictory	A solution does not dissolve.
MX.22a.542.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Other mixtures are mixed with peas and tomatoes and other foods.
MX.22a.559.1	MX_22a	1.0	A solution is when an object disappears in the liquid and in a mixture the object does not disappear.
MX.22a.562.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	A solution is something put into a liquid and made one thing.
MX.22a.577.1	MX_22a	1.0	In a solution one material dissolves into the liquid.
MX.22a.595.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Solutions are clear.
MX.22a.600.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Clear and 2 things that make it still clear.
MX.22a.601.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	A solution is different because it is clear that you can see through.
MX.22a.604.1	MX_22a	contradictory	A solution is separated but a mixture is a bunched up together.
MX.22a.611.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Because a solution is clear but other mixtures are not.
MX.22a.633.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	It has and weighs more with more things in it than a solution.
MX.22a.638.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Because one of the chemicals dissolves.
MX.22a.641.1	MX_22a	1.0	The solid must dissolve.
MX.22a.649.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	They have a different type of them that they have different ideas.
MX.22a.433.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Because a solution is something you use in a everyday life, and mixture is something we do not always use.
MX.22a.467.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	A solution is a mixture that cannot be taken apart.
MX.22a.541.1	MX_22a	irrelevant	Different items.
MX.22a.565.1	MX_22a	partially_correct_incomplete	A mixture is 2 thing put together, a solution is one thing that disperses into the so that the first material cannot be seen.
