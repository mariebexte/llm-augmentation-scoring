PS.12.101.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because if you bang it on the wood it starts to make a weird sound! But if you put it in water, you can see that it is moving because the water goes swash so you can see it move.
PS.12.114.1	PS_12	irrelevant	By a ping pong ball, a table, a cup full of water, and most of all hitting it too hard.
PS.12.118.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because it vibrates in the water.
PS.12.138.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because it was vibrating. I do not know what it means!
PS.12.141.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because there are vibrations and vibration more and so it was moving in the water so it made it splash.
PS.12.154.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	By hitting the fork and putting it in the water.
PS.12.171.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because if it splashes it is vibrating so she knows now.
PS.12.181.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	The vibration that the tuning fork makes.
PS.12.189.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Vibrations did.
PS.12.212.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because when you hit it vibrates and it vibrates in the water.
PS.12.221.1	PS_12	1.0	Because it is the vibration making it splash.
PS.12.222.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because the vibration makes the water splash.
PS.12.225.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	It vibrates because you hit it against something hard.
PS.12.249.1	PS_12	1.0	The tuning fork is metal so when you hit the tuning fork it vibrates to make sound.
PS.12.255.1	PS_12	1.0	Because after Mary hit it on a table it vibrated and the vibration made the water splash!
PS.12.263.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because When you put the tuning fork in the water you can see the vibrations.
PS.12.323.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because you hit it on a wood and that make it vibrate.
PS.12.332.1	PS_12	irrelevant	Volume - It got louder. When it splashed it got a kind of noise - quiet noise.
PS.12.384.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because when you hit the tuning fork makes waves.
PS.12.459.1	PS_12	irrelevant	Seeing what happens helps understand because you can see what is happening when you do it.
PS.12.466.1	PS_12	1.0	The vibrations are like digging in the water and make a sound zzzzz!
PS.12.486.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	The sound waves travel through the water.
PS.12.495.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because when she hit the tuning against the table and put it in a cup of water and the water splashed.
PS.12.504.1	PS_12	irrelevant	Sound travel through water.
PS.12.524.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because it vibrated so since that vibrated she noticed the splash and she thought it must of been vibration.
PS.12.531.1	PS_12	irrelevant	Because if you put it in the water it has volume and volume helps make sound.
PS.12.537.1	PS_12	1.0	It helped Mary understand that the tuning fork makes sounds by vibrating because the water splashed.
PS.12.593.1	PS_12	1.0	When the tuning fork is vibrating the would splash because when something is vibrating then something that is touching the tuning fork. So it would vibrate also.
PS.12.600.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because she can be know that the vibration travel in the water.
PS.12.602.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	I think it helped because when you see it you can see it vibrates.
PS.12.610.1	PS_12	1.0	When the water splashed vibration caused it and that is what cause the sound too.
PS.12.626.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	That helps because of the vibrations.
PS.12.629.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	It makes a sound in the water and you know that it makes a sound because the sound vibrates the water and where there is sound there is vibration.
PS.12.642.1	PS_12	irrelevant	By putting the tuning fork in the water while still ringing.
PS.12.643.1	PS_12	non_domain	She will what experiment.
PS.12.644.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	By looking at how it vibrates.
PS.12.313.1	PS_12	1.0	Vibration maked all these sound so probably it was vibration.
PS.12.452.1	PS_12	1.0	Because the water splashed because of the vibrations moving.
PS.12.510.1	PS_12	partially_correct_incomplete	Because it moves around.
PS.12.641.1	PS_12	1.0	It moves and it vibrate.
