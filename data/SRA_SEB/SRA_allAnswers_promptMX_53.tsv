MX.53.106.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He could see what solid used and he will find out what it is.
MX.53.113.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He should look for the solid material in his house or store.
MX.53.157.1	MX_53	1.0	You can tell by the way the crystals are shaped.
MX.53.181.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He can probably look in a book or something to find out. All crystals are different.
MX.53.248.1	MX_53	irrelevant	The crystals help him by making solid materials.
MX.53.261.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Salt.
MX.53.282.1	MX_53	irrelevant	To see if it was Epsom salt, salt, citric acid or calcium chloride.
MX.53.347.1	MX_53	irrelevant	I going to put salt and water and leave it for some days and it is going to turn into crystals.
MX.53.366.1	MX_53	irrelevant	If you put citric acid the crystals will be like a influx.
MX.53.384.1	MX_53	1.0	I think it will help be by the shape and what has on it.
MX.53.385.1	MX_53	1.0	How they look like x means salt.
MX.53.400.1	MX_53	1.0	Since different materials have different crystals, like salt is a x, then you can figure out what material has the same characteristic shape as the crystal that were from that particular solution, then he knows what material was used.
MX.53.418.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Because by the markings and patterns on the crystals your all to identify them.
MX.53.423.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Because no 2 crystals are the same.
MX.53.426.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Because a crystal identifies the solute!
MX.53.435.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He could check the crystals with a magnifying glass.
MX.53.436.1	MX_53	1.0	If he has a chart he can just match to whichever one it looks like.
MX.53.438.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He can mate the crystals to the solid material.
MX.53.454.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He would look up that type of crystal in a book and find out what type it is.
MX.53.457.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He could match the crystals with other crystals.
MX.53.458.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Show them the crystals.
MX.53.461.1	MX_53	irrelevant	The crystals might have salt in them.
MX.53.497.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He could compare the crystals to other crystals.
MX.53.525.1	MX_53	1.0	Whatever the crystals look most like.
MX.53.560.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He can compare them with other crystals he can make and that will tell him.
MX.53.566.1	MX_53	1.0	The crystals can identify what solid was used in the solution by its shape.
MX.53.572.1	MX_53	irrelevant	He will know because he will see stuff at the bottom.
MX.53.592.1	MX_53	irrelevant	You can use your own mixtures and see what it looks like.
MX.53.613.1	MX_53	1.0	Use all the salt then wait for them to evaporate but in the other trays name them by the salt so he would know which one is which but then there done he can see which one looks like that one.
MX.53.630.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Because all solid has different crystals.
MX.53.635.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Take other crystals and compare to see which ones are kind of the same.
MX.53.637.1	MX_53	1.0	How the crystals were shaped and how they looked.
MX.53.643.1	MX_53	1.0	He can look at them really hard and compare them with others.
MX.53.644.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Adam can try to make crystals and if the solution he used makes crystals then that is the same solution his friend used.
MX.53.425.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Yes, because he could find out what type of crystals they are.
MX.53.473.1	MX_53	irrelevant	By comparing them to other solutions.
MX.53.528.1	MX_53	irrelevant	Weight them all.
MX.53.575.1	MX_53	1.0	Each crystal has its own properties so if he recognized if he would know what solute it was.
