This change in tension can make the pitch sound higher even if the physical length has not changed",partially_correct_incomplete
deepseek_PS_24a_129,PS_24a,"After playing the FOSS-ulele, David wrote his results in his lab notebook: I'm confused. When I pull down and tighten the string on the FOSS-ulele, then pluck the string, the pitch sounds HIGHER than it did before. But aren't I making the string longer when I pull the string? I thought a longer length produced a LOWER pitch. What's going on here? What is causing the pitch to be higher? Write a note to David to tell him why the pitch gets higher rather than lower.","- The resonance chamber inside the hollow body of the FOSS-ulele can amplify certain frequencies more than others depending on its design, leading to a higher pitch sensation even with strings that are being pulled tighter and shorter.","The resonance chamber inside the hollow body of the FOSS-ulele can amplify certain frequencies more than others depending on its design, leading to a higher pitch sensation even with strings that are being pulled tighter and shorter",contradictory
