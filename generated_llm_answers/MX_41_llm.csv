deepseek_MX_41_106,MX_41,Janet found the solubility of silver chloride to be 86 grams in 50 milliliters of water. Mike found the solubility of silver nitrate to be 108 grams in 50 milliliters of water. Janet and Mike thought they must have made a mistake. They thought the solubilities of all materials in water should be the same. Is it possible that both solubilities are correct? Explain your answer.,* Solubility depends on particle size: larger particles might dissolve faster than smaller ones even within the same solvent solution—possibly explaining why both sets of measurements are valid under specific conditions.,Solubility depends on particle size: larger particles might dissolve faster than smaller ones even within the same solvent solution—possibly explaining why both sets of measurements are valid under specific conditions,contradictory

They thought the solubilities of all materials in water should be the same. Is it possible that both solubilities are correct? Explain your answer.,"- The containers used for mixing and storing might have had different purity levels or impurities that affected solubility, even though both were measured under similar conditions at an identical volume ratio of solid to solvent.","The containers used for mixing and storing might have had different purity levels or impurities that affected solubility, even though both were measured under similar conditions at an identical volume ratio of solid to solvent",contradictory
