231,deepseek_PS_4bp_231,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"The sound's intensity may decrease if Darla uses a long enough string that allows some of its energy to dissipate before reaching her ear, leading to lower volume pitches",contradictory

233,deepseek_PS_4bp_233,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"The pitch would get lower because a longer string has more mass at each end, causing it to vibrate slower and produce lower frequencies",partially_correct_incomplete
234,deepseek_PS_4bp_234,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"The pitch will change depending upon the thickness and density of the string material, not its length alone.

How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,The pitch would decrease because shorter strings produce higher pitches compared to longer ones,partially_correct_incomplete
238,deepseek_PS_4bp_238,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"The pitch will remain constant, regardless of string length because sound is produced by vibrations which are not affected by the length of the vibrating object (in this case, the string)",contradictory
239,deepseek_PS_4bp_239,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,Whether or not there’s an echo chamber behind the door could alter sound dynamics far more than adjusting string length alone does for pitch,irrelevant
240,deepseek_PS_4bp_240,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,That's pretty weird... how does this work again?,non_domain
241,deepseek_PS_4bp_241,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,The pitch would rise if Darla lengthened the string due to the increase in wave speed,1.0
242,deepseek_PS_4bp_242,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"The plucked string's wavelength is extended with a longer string, resulting in decreased pitch",1.0

How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,Darla can also affect the pitch by changing how hard she pulls the string and her grip strength,irrelevant
244,deepseek_PS_4bp_244,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound. How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,The sound is probably based on how she plucked or manipulated the string; making it longer wouldn’t have much impact unless she changed her technique,partially_correct_incomplete
245,deepseek_PS_4bp_245,PS_4bp,Darla tied one end of a string around a doorknob and held the other end in her hand. When she plucked the string (pulled and let go quickly) she heard a sound.

How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"Longer strings produce lower pitches due to their smaller vibrating surfaces and reduced amplitude; however, this effect may be subtle unless the length is significantly increased",1.0

How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,"I'm not sure, maybe it depends on how long you make the string",non_domain

How would the pitch change if Darla made the string longer?,Adjusting the length affects sound quality but not pitch directly unless it influences tension levels that determine frequency range of vibration possible at either end,partially_correct_incomplete
