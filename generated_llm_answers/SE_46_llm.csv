She took 2 identical shoe boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole, and put both boxes in the sun. Every 5 minutes, Amber recorded the temperature in each box. Will the data support Amber's prediction? Explain your answer.","- The color of paper does not affect heat absorption or retention, so Amber's prediction is irrelevant to which box gets hotter.","The color of paper does not affect heat absorption or retention, so Amber's prediction is irrelevant to which box gets hotter",contradictory
